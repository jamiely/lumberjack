* The game field should be the same size and the attract and game over screens. (Keep in mind later they will be scaled up.)
* When on the Attract screen or Game over screen, the player should see the game running (but not playable). For the Game Over screen, the player should see the final state of the game, where the branch intersects them.
* As the player chops the tree, make the segment fly away in the direction opposite the player.
* Move everything except the debug info on top of the playfield, so it displays kind of like a mobile app.
* Press either left or right arrow to restart.
