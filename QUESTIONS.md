# Audio Implementation Questions

This document contains questions that need clarification before implementing the audio system outlined in PLAN.md.

**Note:** Several questions have been resolved through codebase analysis and browser configuration. This document now contains only the remaining questions requiring input.

## Phase 2.4: Performance Measurement

### Question 5: Performance Benchmarks and Monitoring
**Context:** The plan specifies performance requirements but lacks measurement methodology.

**Questions:**
Skip this

**Impact:** Determines testing approach and success criteria validation.

## Phase 2.5: Arcade Audio Calibration

### Question 6: Audio Configuration Values
**Context:** The plan includes `ARCADE_AUDIO_CONFIG` with specific values.

**Questions:**
skip

**Impact:** Affects audio quality and arcade environment optimization.

## Additional Implementation Questions

### Question 7: Error Handling Strategy
**Questions:**
- What level of error logging should be implemented for audio failures?
silent failure, console log

- Should audio errors be reported to any analytics or monitoring system?
no

- How should we handle partial audio initialization (some sounds load, others fail)?
best effort

**Impact:** Determines robustness of audio system and debugging capabilities.

## Implementation Dependencies Identified

### Timer System Prerequisite
**Critical Finding:** The current codebase does not implement the timer system specified in GAME_DESIGN.md.

**Required Before Audio Implementation:**
- Add `timeRemaining` property to GameState
- Implement timer countdown logic in game loop
- Add timer extension when chopping successfully
- Add game over condition when timer expires
- Add timer warning event when < 3 seconds remaining

**Question:** Should we implement the timer system as part of Phase 0 (architecture refactoring) or as a separate prerequisite phase?

Separate

**Next Steps:** 
1. Resolve remaining questions above
2. Decide on timer system implementation approach
3. Begin Phase 0 implementation with clear direction

**Resolved Questions:** See RESEARCH.md for answers to Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 that were resolved through codebase analysis and browser configuration.
