# Development Progress

## MVP Implementation - Basic Movement and Tree Chopping
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 2:45 PM

- Created RESEARCH.md with focused MVP plan for simple playable prototype
- Implemented basic lumberjack game in App.tsx with React hooks
- Added player movement using arrow keys (blue square moves left/right)
- Added tree chopping mechanic with spacebar (trees turn green to brown)
- Created simple visual game world with colored rectangles and wood counter
- Game features 4 trees, collision detection, and responsive controls

## Corrected Implementation - Proper Timberman Mechanics
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 3:15 PM

- Updated RESEARCH.md to align with GAME_DESIGN.md requirements
- Removed code examples from RESEARCH.md per user feedback
- Completely rewrote game mechanics to match Timberman gameplay
- Implemented central tree with stacked segments and side-switching player
- Added branch collision detection and game over state
- Created infinite gameplay with random branch generation
- Player now switches between left/right sides of single tree instead of moving around

## Debug Screen Implementation
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 3:45 PM

- Added toggleable debug screen activated by "?" key
- Implemented comprehensive debug information display including game state, coordinates, and tree segments
- Shows real-time player position, current tree segment data, and collision predictions
- Added visual representation of all tree segments with current segment highlighting
- Changed from modal overlay to inline page element for better integration
- Debug panel updates live as game state changes during gameplay

## Collision Detection Bug Fix
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 4:30 PM

- Fixed collision detection timing issue where game ended one round late
- Problem: Collision check was testing current bottom segment instead of next bottom segment
- Solution: Changed collision detection from `treeSegments[0]` to `treeSegments[1]` with safety check
- Game now ends immediately when player would actually hit a branch, matching player expectations

## Code Refactoring - Step 1: Game Logic Extraction
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 10:16 AM

- ✅ Created `src/game/GameState.ts` with interfaces and initial state
- ✅ Created `src/game/GameLogic.ts` with pure functions for chop, collision detection, reset
- ✅ Created `src/game/__tests__/GameLogic.test.ts` - comprehensive tests for collision, scoring, game over
- ✅ Created `src/game/TreeSystem.ts` with branch generation and segment management  
- ✅ Created `src/game/__tests__/TreeSystem.test.ts` - tests for branch generation and tree management
- ✅ Updated App.test.tsx with basic working tests for current game state
- ✅ All tests passing (22/22 tests)

## Code Refactoring - Step 2: UI Components Creation
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 10:19 AM

- ✅ Created `src/components/GameBoard.tsx` for tree and player rendering
- ✅ Created `src/components/__tests__/GameBoard.test.tsx` - comprehensive rendering tests
- ✅ Created `src/components/DebugPanel.tsx` for debug info display
- ✅ Created `src/components/__tests__/DebugPanel.test.tsx` - debug display tests
- ✅ Created `src/components/ScoreDisplay.tsx` for score and game status
- ✅ Created `src/components/__tests__/ScoreDisplay.test.tsx` - score display tests  
- ✅ All tests passing (47/47 tests)

## Code Refactoring - Step 3: Custom Hooks Creation
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 10:21 AM

- ✅ Created `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` for centralized state management
- ✅ Created `src/hooks/__tests__/useGameState.test.ts` - comprehensive state management tests
- ✅ Created `src/hooks/useKeyboardInput.ts` for input handling  
- ✅ Created `src/hooks/__tests__/useKeyboardInput.test.ts` - input handling tests
- ✅ All tests passing (63/63 tests)

## Code Refactoring - Step 4: App.tsx Refactor & Integration
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 10:24 AM

- ✅ Completely refactored App.tsx to use new modular architecture
- ✅ Removed all game logic functions (now using game modules)
- ✅ Removed direct state management (now using useGameState hook)  
- ✅ Removed rendering logic (now using GameBoard, ScoreDisplay, DebugPanel components)
- ✅ App.tsx now only handles high-level component orchestration
- ✅ Replaced placeholder tests with proper integration tests using userEvent
- ✅ All tests passing (64/64 tests)
- ✅ Game functionality fully preserved with clean architecture

## Code Refactoring - Step 5: Integration Test Suite
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 10:31 AM

- ✅ Created `src/__tests__/GameplayIntegration.test.tsx` with comprehensive integration tests
- ✅ Tests cover complete gameplay loop, keyboard input integration, state consistency
- ✅ Tests verify component integration, rapid input handling, and edge cases
- ✅ All integration tests pass with robust userEvent testing
- ✅ All tests passing (69/69 tests)
- Next: Setup ESLint with React/TypeScript presets (Step 6)
