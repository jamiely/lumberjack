# Development Progress

## Character Config Consolidation
**Date:** September 10, 2025 - 12:35 PM

- ✅ Promoted `src/characters/descriptors.ts` to the single source of truth for character metadata (sheet details, poses, facing).
- ✅ Added `descriptorBuilder` utilities and `registry` exports so factories, services, and React components all consume the same generated configs.
- ✅ Updated selection services, registry accessors, and tests to iterate the descriptor-driven registry (no more hard-coded character arrays).
- ✅ Documented the workflow in `GAME_DESIGN.md` and extended unit coverage with `descriptorBuilder` tests to guard against drift.
- ✅ Introduced `src/characters/sharedConfig.ts` with a reusable builder, centering helper, and state mapper.
- ✅ Refactored every lumberjack config to consume the builder so positioning defaults and state lists are generated consistently.
- ✅ Updated the scene factory and renderer layers to rely on the canonical character config and register lumberjack5 without conversions.
- ✅ Added targeted unit coverage for the shared builder and refreshed lumberjack5 expectations to match real sprite data.
- ✅ Validation: `npm run check`, `npm run build`.

## MVP Implementation - Basic Movement and Tree Chopping
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 2:45 PM

- Updated RESEARCH.md to align with GAME_DESIGN.md requirements
- Removed code examples from RESEARCH.md per user feedback
- Completely rewrote game mechanics to match Timberman gameplay
- Implemented central tree with stacked segments and side-switching player
- Added branch collision detection and game over state
- Created infinite gameplay with random branch generation

## Debug Screen Implementation
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 3:45 PM

- Added toggleable debug screen activated by "?" key

## Collision Detection Bug Fix
**Date:** September 9, 2025 - 4:30 PM

- ✅ Removed all game logic functions (now using game modules)
- ✅ Removed direct state management (now using useGameState hook)  
- ✅ Removed rendering logic (now using GameBoard, ScoreDisplay, DebugPanel components)
- ✅ App.tsx now only handles high-level component orchestration
- ✅ Replaced placeholder tests with proper integration tests using userEvent
- ✅ All tests passing (64/64 tests)

- ✅ **GameOverScreen**: End screen with final score display, high score updates, and restart options
- ✅ **Scene Transitions**: Smooth transitions between attract → play → game over → play cycle
- ✅ **High Score Persistence**: localStorage integration for high score tracking across sessions
